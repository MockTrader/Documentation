# MockTrader Documentation


>MockTrader is still under construction! If you'd like to contribute, get in touch with the [owner](mailto:jeremie.beaudoin.1@ulaval.ca) or one of the maintainers. We'd be thrilled to have you onboard! This file will be updated when MockTrader reaches a stable version.


This project was built in order to offer stock market enthusiasts like ourselves a realistic investment simulation. A complete web interface is available for users to learn about stocks by managing their very own mock portfolio(s) and investing in securities from international markets (currently limited to USA and Canada). 

Experienced users or algo-trading enthusiasts can also interact directly with this REST API.



## Available wikis
>Please note that these references are based on the legacy version of MockTrader (LUSE), which is no longer active nor maintained. This warning will be removed once this project is deployed and stable.
