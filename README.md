# MockTrader Documentation


This project was built in order to offer stock market enthusiasts like ourselves a realistic investment simulation. A complete web interface is available for users to learn about stocks by managing their very own mock portfolio(s) and investing in securities from international markets (currently limited to USA and Canada). 

Experienced users or algo-trading enthusiasts can also interact directly with this REST API.
